Recommendations Systems are used for making product recommendations for numerous applications.
Eg: Online shopping, suggesting web sites to read, or suggesting music, movies, books to people. 
Recommendation systems search for people who share tastes and make automatic recommendations based on items that similar people have an affinity towards.

Amazon (Books, Items), Pandora/Spotify (Music), Google (News, Search), YouTube (Videos) are live examples where recommendation systems are made us of.
Content-Based Recommenders make use of the similarity of the items to make recommendations.
Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of usersâ€™ liking to a particular item.

The data sets used are two parts of the MovieLens dataset, to build a model to recommend movies to users. This data has been collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. 

For Content-based method, we have used:
1,000,000 ratings (1-5) from 6040 users on 3900 movies in the year 2000
Demographic information of the users (age, gender, occupation, etc.)

For Collaborative Filtering-based method, we have used:
100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies in the year 1998 
Demographic information of the users (age, gender, occupation, etc.).

We have used a smaller data set for collaborative filtering as this method requires a lot of processing power that is not available on a desktop / laptop.
